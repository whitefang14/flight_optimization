# Flight Optimization

Flight Optimization is a powerful toolkit designed to assist in optimizing flight routes, schedules, and operations. This repository provides algorithms, utilities, and scripts for analyzing and improving various aspects of flight planning and airline operations, with an emphasis on efficiency, cost reduction, and environmental impact.

## Features

- **Route Optimization:** Find optimal flight paths based on distance, time, fuel, or custom constraints.
- **Schedule Management:** Tools for creating, adjusting, and visualizing flight schedules.
- **Cost Analysis:** Estimate and minimize operational costs including fuel, crew, and airport fees.
- **Environmental Impact:** Analyze and minimize carbon emissions across flight plans.
- **Simulation & Visualization:** Simulate route changes and display results with clear visual outputs.
- **Extensible Algorithms:** Easily add new optimization strategies or integrate with external data sources.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ (or update to match your requirements)
- Recommended: pip, virtualenv

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/whitefang14/flight_optimization.git
cd flight_optimization
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

#### Command Line

Most tools can be run from the command line. For example, to optimize a flight route:

```bash
python optimize_route.py --input routes.csv --output optimized_routes.csv
```

#### As a Python Library

You can also import modules in your own Python scripts:

```python
from flight_optimization.route import optimize_route

optimized = optimize_route(route_data)
```

Example scripts and Jupyter notebooks are provided in the `examples/` directory.
